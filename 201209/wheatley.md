Legacy code is annoying. Imagine how cool it would be if robots would fix your legacy code for you!

[Wheatley](https://github.com/gilesbowkett/wheatley) was designed to refactor JavaScript semi-automatically. The project's unfinished, because writing code which will refactor your JavaScript for you automatically is just insanely overambitious, but the few refactorings it can do are very cool. Wheatley can also recognize identical code and nearly-identical code.
